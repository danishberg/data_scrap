US officials said there were no reports of casualties.\n\nThe energy markets are now focused on developments in the Strait of Hormuz, where a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquefied natural gas trade passes. If the Hormuz is affected and closes, the markets may turn again.\n\n\"The waterway handles significant volumes for global markets and its importance cannot be understated,\" added Janiv Shah, a vice president of oil markets analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\nIn an earlier Truth Social post, Trump described Iran's retaliatory attack as a \"very weak response,\" and thanked Tehran for giving the US early notice of the strikes.\n\nAJ Bell investment director Russ Mould wrote in a note on Tuesday that markets \"will be watching closely to see if the cessation in hostilities is maintained and for Iran's next move.\"\n\n\"There are still outstanding questions, from whether a ceasefire will hold given that mutual strikes had continued overnight, to the future of what remains of Iran's nuclear programme,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a blog on Tuesday.\n\n\"But as things stand, the past 12 days look set to join the long list of geopolitical shocks that proved temporarily disruptive but had little lasting effect on markets,\" they added.",

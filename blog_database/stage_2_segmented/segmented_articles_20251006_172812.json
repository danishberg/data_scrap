      "content": "In Sunset Boulevard, faded movie star Norma Desmond famously rejects the idea of making a comeback, saying, \"I hate that word. It's a return.\" Well, call it what you'd like, but after a summer hiatus, Amazon Prime Day is once again ready for its close-up. The seasonal savings event, which is officially dubbed \"Amazon Prime Big Deal Days\" (and often referred to as \"October Prime Day\"), promises mega markdowns on sought-after brands. Set to kick off on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and wrap up on Wednesday, Oct. 8, it's sure to be just what the doctor ordered for us bargain-batty folk who don't want to wait until Black Friday for deep discounts. Think of it as a glamorous interlude before the shopping star returns after Thanksgiving\n\n\n\nFirst Prime Day matinee? I've got you. I've answered some of the most frequently asked questions below, and I'll be back in as we get closer to the curtain call. Oh, and if you want to get some early-bird shopping in, I've rounded up the best early October Prime Day deals I'm seeing as we speak.\n\nThe best early October Prime Day deals\n\nAmazon Ring Battery Doorbell $50 $100 Save $50 \"When I moved into my house six years ago, it came with a doorbell outside and an old-school chime inside — but neither had been hooked up in who knows how long. We needed a replacement, so we went with a Ring,\" says Senior Deals Writer Chris McGraw. \"It was super easy to install, doesn't need to be charged all that often and the subscription is surprisingly cheap (though I am getting pretty sick of everything being a subscription these days).\" At a rare 50% off, it's within $2 of its all-time low. $50 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Eddie Bauer Reversible Throw Blanket $14 $30 Save $16 Is it just me, or are plaid throw blankets cozier than others? Whether or not that's true, this one — at more than 50% off — certainly isn't lacking in couch-cuddling appeal: One side is made of soft fleece while the other is faux shearling for extra plushness. Wrap yourself up in it with some popcorn and a movie, and you've got an autumn night I'd describe as \"iconic\" — almost as iconic as this near-all-time-low price (it's only dropped a dollar lower). $14 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple AirPods 4 $90 $129 Save $39 If you've been holding off on buying AirPods until there's a sale, consider this the time to pounce. At just $90, this pair is just a dollar more than the best price I've ever seen for it. Now, they don't include active noise cancellation like these do, but if it's a high-quality, comfortable listening experience you're after, these earbuds more than deliver. With up to five hours of listening time per charge (and 30 hours of battery life via the charging case), you'll be able to enjoy music, podcasts, audiobooks and more with limited interruption. $90 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Crest 3D Whitestrips $30 $46 Save $16 with Prime This comprehensive kit is one of Amazon's most popular tooth-whitening treatments thanks to its pro-level, smile-brightening effects. The pack comes with 22 treatments, with one upper and one lower strip for each sesh. With the new \"advanced seal technology,\" these strips no longer slip, so you can drink water and even talk while using them. Just peel a strip off, apply it over your teeth, leave it for about 30-45 minutes and voila! You'll start to notice a whiter smile in as little as three days, with the full effect in about 20.

As mentioned, the sale kicks off on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and runs through Wednesday, Oct. 8. Set a reminder, or you might miss out on this shorter discount window!\n\nWhat will be on sale during October Prime Day?\n\nWhile we won't know exact markdowns until the sale begins, previous Prime Day events have been excellent times to score rarely discounted tech for near-record-low or record-low prices. (We're always on the lookout for Apple products in particular.) Seasonal clothing and style finds are another popular category — grab a winter coat and some boots for less before the first frost! — as well as small home appliances like air fryers, air purifiers and vacuums. Finally, it's a smart time to shop for holiday gifts before the Black Friday rush, and you'll feel so accomplished knowing you've checked some items off your list before you've even doled out Halloween candy.\n\nDo I need to have an Amazon Prime membership to shop Prime Day deals?\n\nHaving an Amazon Prime membership isn't a prerequisite; there are always deals that everyone can enjoy. That said, many of the best Prime Day deals are reserved for Prime members, so having a subscription will allow you to make the most of the sale. Signing up is a cinch, and new members can even opt for a free 30-day trial (after which, you'll be charged $139 each year — and you can cancel anytime).\n\nSpecial delivery! Get ready to see a lot of Amazon boxes on your doorstep... (Amazon)\n\nIf you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)\n\nShop Prime Day deals: Early October Prime Day 2025 deals | Early Prime Day tech deals | Best credit card for Amazon",

Log in .\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nGold has been on a record-setting blitz this year. But Chinese investors are increasingly turning their backs on the precious metal in favor of a surging domestic stock market.\n\nIn August, China's wholesale gold demand fell to just 85 metric tons — nine tons lower than in July.

Prices have been on the up this year thanks to Fed rate cut bets, geopolitical tensions, and President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nWary, price-weary Chinese investors\n\nIn China, consumers have been reliable buyers of gold over the past two years, particularly after an ongoing property crisis and a stock market slump left few attractive investment alternatives.\n\nJewelry purchases rebounded in 2023 and 2024, and retail investors piled into gold ETFs as a hedge against economic uncertainty and a weakening yuan.\n\nBut 2025 has been different. Despite the People's Bank of China adding to its gold reserves for 10 straight months, private demand has stumbled.\n\nETF investors pulled 6 billion Chinese yuan, or $834 million, in August, cutting holdings by 7.7 tons, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nGold futures trading activity on the Shanghai Futures Exchange also fell 26% from July to August.\n\nPart of the problem is price fatigue: Gold's relentless climb has deterred new buying.\n\nThe tonnage of gold withdrawn from the Shanghai Gold Exchange — the best proxy for wholesale demand — has remained muted throughout 2025 compared with historical averages.\n\nChinese equities catch fire\n\nWhile gold demand has faltered, equities have surged.\n\nThe CSI300 Index, which tracks China's largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 10% in August and is about 16% higher year to date.\n\nThat surge came on the back of aggressive policy support, including liquidity injections and pledges to bolster consumer spending and technology investment.\n\nRetail traders, often described as the lifeblood of China's stock market, have poured back in. Daily equity trading volumes have swelled, coinciding with declines in gold futures activity.\n\nThe contrast underscores how investors are rotating out of traditional safe-haven assets and into riskier plays as confidence returns.\n\nHowever, gold investment demand in China could rebound later this year, supported by seasonal buying around the National Day holiday in October and various jewelry fairs in September, according to the World Gold Council.",

      "title": "The best body washes of 2025, according to extensive testing",
      "content": "Though it may seem like a \"no-duh\" fact, we all know that a great shower can truly make a big difference in our day. In fact, studies have shown that hot showers actually reduce stress by stimulating the release of oxytocin. Frankly, once you throw the best body wash into the mix, you’ve got everything you need to give a boost to your mental and physical well-being — and it all costs way less than a therapy session!\n\n\n\nCompared to face cleanser (or any other anti-aging skin care), body wash is often cast aside as unimportant. But skin is our body’s largest organ, of course — and if you want to keep it healthy, it’s imperative to treat every part of it well, not just your face. For their part, body washes do so much more than cleanse; they can treat breakouts, bring more moisture into the skin and even help with wrinkles and rough texture (crepey arms, anyone?). A solid body-care routine, both in and out of the shower, helps keep skin glowing and youthful-looking. Think about it: Body sunscreens help protect your skin from sun damage, while body scrubs and washes exfoliate dead skin cells. If you want to level up your shower time — and care for your skin at the same time — the easiest thing to do is get yourself an amazing body wash.\n\n\n\nI'm a bit of a body wash obsessive. Over my decade plus as a beauty reporter and editor, I’ve tested and reviewed dozens of, if not a hundred or so, body washes. The following are my favorites right now — and why you might love them too.\n\nTable of contents\n\nUpdate, August 27, 2025: We checked all product prices and availability. Our No. 1 pick for the best body wash remains the same, and we will update this post as we test more products.\n\nThe best body wash of 2025\n\nRare Beauty Best overall body wash Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Find Comfort Gentle Exfoliating Body Wash Benefits: Moisturizes, cleanses, exfoliates | Key ingredients: Konjac jelly, ashwagandha, peach flower extract, avocado oil | Size: 8.45 oz. | Scent: Citrus/woody Rare Beauty, Selena Gomez’s beauty brand, is centered around mental health, so it was only a matter of time before it started focusing on the comforting aspects of body care. The Find Comfort Body Wash (perfect name) has everything going for it. The formula starts out with a jelly-type texture and then transforms into a milky cream that feels soft and silky on the skin. But it doesn’t just cleanse; it has gentle exfoliation, thanks to konjac jelly. If you want something that’ll help with uneven skin texture but aren’t in the mood to use a regular body scrub, this is a great choice. Other key ingredients include the stress-relieving Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha, peach flower extract, which protects against oxidative stress, and moisturizing avocado oil. The fragrance is one of the biggest highlights, IMO. It has notes of citrusy lemon with jasmine and cashmere wood that make me feel cozy and refreshed at the same time, or even nostalgic and brand-new! Someone give the Rare Beauty perfumer a raise for messing with my head (in a good way). Pros Exfoliates and moisturizes skin\n\nFree of parabens, formaldehyde, mineral oil and more\n\nInnovative formula is both foamy and creamy\n\nTop-quality ingredients\n\nDelightful citrus/woodsy scent Cons Fragrance may be too strong for some\n\nPricey than others on our list $24 at Sephora\n\n(back to top)\n\nMore body washes we love\n\nNative Best budget body wash Native Body Wash Coconut & Vanilla Benefits: Moisturizes, cleanses, repels mosquitoes | Key ingredients: Citric acid | Size: 36 oz. | Scent: Coconut and Vanilla (many other options available) I swear by Native’s natural deodorants and can co-sign its body wash too. It comes in dozens of different fragrance options (including a Girl Scout Cookie collaboration), but I was impressed by its classic Coconut and Vanilla scent. It smells nice but is still pretty light compared to most body washes, which is appealing to people who are sensitive to scents. Overall, this is a simple yet solid body wash that’s free from parabens, sulfates, phthalates, dyes, etc. but still does the job. If that wasn’t enough to convince you, take a look at this interesting fun fact. A 2023 study found that Native body wash repelled mosquitoes, and a coconut scent seemed to repel them the most! Pros Great value for cost\n\nFree of dyes, phthalates and sulfates\n\nWide fragrance range Cons Doesn’t include any bonus skin-nourishing ingredients\n\nSome complaints about pump not working correctly $13 at Target Explore More Buying Options $23 at Amazon$23 at Walmart\n\nPhilip B. Best luxury body wash Philip B. Forever Shine Body Wash Benefits: Moisturizes, cleanses, nourishes skin | Key ingredients: Amino acids, peptides, safflower oleosomes | Size: 11.8 oz. | Scent: Velvet Oud Whenever I want a “rich lady shower,” I reach for this. First of all, it looks rich. The gold-hued formula has tiny bubbles that make it look filled with glittering gold specks. It’s a trick of the eye, but I still feel like a pampered princess since it’s pumped with skin-nourishing pea peptides, L-amino acids, and safflower oleosomes. This luxurious body wash has a luxurious scent to match — the heavy oud fragrance hits you like a magnificent brick but doesn’t linger on your skin too long afterward, so it won’t interfere with your perfume for the day. I call this body wash a “splurge,” but it should also get the title “most sophisticated.” Pros Moisturizing\n\nFeels very luxurious Cons Scent might be too strong for sensitive noses $75 at Bloomingdale's Explore More Buying Options $75 at Lovely Skin\n\nNécessaire Most invigorating body wash Nécessaire the Body Wash Eucalyptus Benefits: Moisturizes, cleanses, anti-aging | Key ingredients: Niacinamide, glycerin, marula, meadowfoam and cacay oils | Size: 8.4 oz. | Scent: Eucalyptus (comes in other scents and fragrance-free option) Once you squeeze Nécessaire’s the Body Wash onto your loofah, you’ll understand why it’s become such a popular classic. The first time I tried it, I let out a deep sigh, like I’d been waiting my whole life for this body wash. While the brand put out newer fragrance options, like Santal, Olibanum and Hinoki (a seriously luxurious smell!), the original Eucalyptus scent is absolutely invigorating. It makes any shower, whether five minutes or 20, feel like an instant spa experience. The combination of marula, cacay and meadowfoam oils is a treat for skin in need of moisture, but this body wash has even more benefits. The formula also contains niacinamide, a powerful antioxidant that strengthens the skin barrier, protects the skin from oxidative stress and reduces aging signs and hyperpigmentation.

Its Deep Moisture Body Wash lives up to its name as it feels highly moisturizing on the skin and leaves it feeling that way after you wash it off. It contains the brand’s MicroMoisture technology, which is made up of skin nourishers like glycerin and stearic and palmitic fatty acids that penetrate the skin’s outer layer. It’s also vegan, PETA-approved, and free of sulfates and parabens. Plus, it’s another great budget buy. With 30 ounces per container, you get a lot of product that’ll last through dozens of showers.

For this particular story, I whittled down the best body washes out of dozens I’ve tested over the years — I tested them by reviewing:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIngredient quality\n\nPrice and value\n\nTexture and consistency, as in how the formula felt on my skin\n\nScent range and quality — were the scents cloying or overpowering?\n\nWash efficacy — did my skin feel clean or did the product leave a film?\n\nSkin conditioning factor — if the product said it would moisturize or exfoliate, did it achieve this promise?\n\n(back to top)\n\nOthers we tested that didn’t make the cut\n\nOlay Indulgent Moisture Body Wash : While I found this super hydrating, it contains petrolatum and mineral oil, which is problematic for some people.\n\nMethod Body Wash: This was decent and affordably priced, but it wasn’t special enough to include on the list. It also contains ammonium chloride — another shady ingredient — which can be irritating to sensitive skin.\n\n(back to top)\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat should I look for in a body wash?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best ingredients in body washes, it depends on your skin type and concerns. For example, for people dealing with acne or chest breakouts, salicylic acid body washes are a great start. However, there are also certain ingredients that hold numerous benefits for everyone: Niacinamide — which is found in Necessaire’s the Body Wash — is a good example. In general, a good rule of thumb is to look for products with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and plant-based oils and butters.\n\nWhich ingredients should I avoid in body washes?\n\nIf you have sensitive skin, you might want to avoid heavy fragrances and essential oils. You’ll also find that many body washes (and regular skin care products) do the so-called dirty work for you. They’ll make it a point to avoid harsh or irritating ingredients like parabens, formaldehydes, phthalates and sulfates.\n\nIs body wash better than bar soap?\n\nNot really! Both types of products are usually formulated with skin-benefiting ingredients. The big difference is the form that they come in, which has both pros and cons. Using a bar of soap when you shower can create less waste (you don’t have to worry about plastic), but bar formulations are also less pristine — that is, they’re more prone to being exposed to bathroom dirt and bacteria.\n\nHow do I use body wash?\n\nUsing body wash is pretty straightforward. When it’s time to get into the shower or tub, get your skin wet. Then, use a small amount of body wash on your loofah or washcloth and lather it across your skin. Afterward, rinse it off with water, making sure you don’t leave any residue.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n(back to top)\n\nBest body wash specs comparison chart\n\nBenefits Key ingredients Size Scent Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Find Comfort Gentle Exfoliating Body Wash Moisturizes, cleanses, exfoliates Konjac jelly, ashwagandha, peach flower extract, avocado oil 8.45 oz.

In fact, studies have shown that hot showers actually reduce stress by stimulating the release of oxytocin. Frankly, once you throw the best body wash into the mix, you’ve got everything you need to give a boost to your mental and physical well-being — and it all costs way less than a therapy session!",
        "Compared to face cleanser (or any other anti-aging skin care), body wash is often cast aside as unimportant. But skin is our body’s largest organ, of course — and if you want to keep it healthy, it’s imperative to treat every part of it well, not just your face. For their part, body washes do so much more than cleanse; they can treat breakouts, bring more moisture into the skin and even help with wrinkles and rough texture (crepey arms, anyone?). A solid body-care routine, both in and out of the shower, helps keep skin glowing and youthful-looking. Think about it: Body sunscreens help protect your skin from sun damage, while body scrubs and washes exfoliate dead skin cells. If you want to level up your shower time — and care for your skin at the same time — the easiest thing to do is get yourself an amazing body wash.",

The Find Comfort Body Wash (perfect name) has everything going for it. The formula starts out with a jelly-type texture and then transforms into a milky cream that feels soft and silky on the skin. But it doesn’t just cleanse; it has gentle exfoliation, thanks to konjac jelly. If you want something that’ll help with uneven skin texture but aren’t in the mood to use a regular body scrub, this is a great choice. Other key ingredients include the stress-relieving Ayurvedic herb ashwagandha, peach flower extract, which protects against oxidative stress, and moisturizing avocado oil. The fragrance is one of the biggest highlights, IMO. It has notes of citrusy lemon with jasmine and cashmere wood that make me feel cozy and refreshed at the same time, or even nostalgic and brand-new!

      "content": "The Aluminum Association released preliminary estimates as part of its monthly Aluminum Situation statistical report that show a 4.4% year-over-year decline in aluminum demand for North America (U.S. and Canada) through H1 of 2025. While a significant decline in exports was a main contributor to the overall contraction, demand fell in all market segments, with the exception of foil.\n\n“We are carefully monitoring the market as more data becomes available on how the current tariff landscape is impacting the industry,” said Charles Johnson, president & CEO of the Aluminum Association. “As we look ahead, it’s critical to ensure trade policies support — not strain — the U.S. aluminum industry. With 98% of American aluminum jobs in the mid-and downstream sectors, we need a more targeted trade approach that protects against unfair practices while keeping America’s aluminum industry strong and competitive.”\n\nAmong key takeaways from the report:\n\nAluminum demand in the United States and Canada (shipments by domestic producers plus imports) totaled an estimated 13.1 billion pounds through June 2025, declining 4.4% from the like-2024 total of 13.7 billion pounds\n\nThe association's Domestic Producers Shipments & Inventories report indicates that producer shipments from U.S. and Canadian facilities decreased 4.5% year-over-year through June. This number excludes imports to more clearly reflect industry aluminum and aluminum product shipments by North American firms.\n\nThe decline in domestic producer shipments was driven primarily by a decline in aluminum mill products, which contracted 1.6% while shipments of aluminum ingot for castings, exports and destructive uses declined 11% year-over-year.\n\nAluminum scrap inventory increased 14.7% so far in 2025, driven by tariff policy that is incentivizing the use of scrap.\n\nImports of aluminum and aluminum products into North America increased 15.8% year-over-year in the first half, entirely driven by imports of unwrought aluminum.\n\nThe U.S. aluminum industry invested more than $10 billion in U.S. operations over the past 10 years, powered by strong demand, strategic trade enforcement and a stable policy environment. The Trump administration has consistently acknowledged aluminum’s critical role in both economic and national security. However, the administration’s universal 50% aluminum tariff risks undoing hard-earned gains and jeopardizes a decade of progress. The Aluminum Association is calling on policymakers to pursue a more focused, targeted approach to trade—one that strengthens the domestic industry without disrupting the 98% of industry jobs that rely on access to affordable aluminum inputs.\n\nThe Aluminum Situation report is one of more than two-dozen ongoing industry statistical reports developed exclusively by the Aluminum Association through surveys of aluminum producers, fabricators and recyclers.

We needed a replacement, so we went with a Ring,\" says Senior Deals Writer Chris McGraw. \"It was super easy to install, doesn't need to be charged all that often and the subscription is surprisingly cheap (though I am getting pretty sick of everything being a subscription these days).\" At a rare 50% off, it's within $2 of its all-time low. $50 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple AirPods 4 $90 $129 Save $39 If you've been holding off on buying AirPods until there's a sale, consider this the time to pounce.

Really, they couldn't be easier to use — just make sure your mugs are frozen for at least 24 hours, then mix up your ice cream base (there's a recipe book included). Once your mugs are sufficiently chilled (you want them to be really cold), you'll add your base, turn 'em on and they'll start churning away. You can also add mix-ins of your choosing via the pour chutes while they're running, and in about 20 minutes, you'll have ice cream. Simple, right? This duo rarely dips lower than this, so scoop 'em up for their lowest price in months.

That said, the model I have doesn't double as an air fryer — but this one does. It's large enough to roast a 6-pound chicken and vegetables at the same time, or 20 cookies, or a 12-pound turkey, or ... yeah, it's pretty darn big. Is it cheap? No, but this deal slashes the price by about 35%, and markdowns larger than that are very rare. $230 at Amazon\n\nBest early October Prime Day deals: All-time low prices\n\nAmazon Apple iPad Air $449 $599 Save $150 | Lowest price ever If a sleek design is at the top of your tablet wishlist, this latest model — which is down to its best price ever — has your name on it.

Sold! Everyone needs a pair of these come boot season, since they can slide right into styles narrow and wide, and is there a more classic (not to mention, comfy) fall uniform than a slouchy sweater worn over these stretchy pants?

Save $4 with coupon | Lowest price ever $6 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Travelambo RFID-Blocking Wallet $11 $13 Save $2 with coupon Yes, this sleek wallet has style, but its RFID-blocking capabilities also provide peace of mind by protecting sensitive information inside.

That means you could go as long as a month without having to clean it out, saving you even more time. It's powerful enough to zap up everything from the kids' crumbs to Fido's fur, and its 360-degree LiDAR vision allows it to sense and move around any larger objects and furniture it comes across. The Matrix Clean feature encourages it to work in a grid pattern for more thorough coverage, and according to the brand, it'll run for up to two hours before needing a recharge.

Wrap yourself up in it with some popcorn and a movie, and you've got an autumn night I'd describe as \"iconic\" — almost as iconic as this near-all-time-low price (it's only dropped a dollar lower). $14 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Wolfmen Leaf Blower $65 $100 Save $35 | Lowest price ever You love the cooler temps fall brings, but the leaf maintenance? Not so much. But that's why tools like this cordless wonder exist. It's lightweight, but can reach speeds as fast as 150 mph to clear your yard in no time, and because it comes with two batteries, you'll be able to work for up to an hour before needing a charge (30 minutes per battery on low speed). This is its lowest-ever price at 35% off. Save $35 | Lowest price ever $65 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) $170 $249 Save $79 There's a reason folks are gaga for the latest model of these top-rated earbuds — many reasons, in fact. For starters, they're a rare $79 off; plus, they offer rich, crisp sound and superior noise cancellation, allowing you to enjoy music, podcasts, audiobooks and more without outside commotion getting in the way. This model lets you control the volume simply by swiping the stem, and you'll receive four pairs of silicone tips in different sizes for customized comfort. Senior Tech Writer Rick Broida named these \"best wireless earbuds overall,\" saying, \"What you get here is even better ANC, a bump in battery life, extra-small ear tips for users with smaller ears and an adaptive-audio mode that adjusts noise-cancellation and transparency modes based on the sounds around you. Meanwhile, Apple's charging case now has a speaker (for use with Find My) and a USB-C port in place of Lightning (the better to match with the USB-C iPhone 15).\" $170 at Amazon\n\nAmazon RedTiger 4K Dash Cam $85 $150 Save $65 | Lowest price ever Accidents, unfortunately, happen, and if you happen to have one on the road, you'll be glad you had this camera to record the incident. According to McGraw, this one \"can capture what's going on outside your car in 4K, which is important when you're trying to make out details like license plate numbers, especially when you're driving at night. Speaking of nighttime driving, the f/1.5 aperture lens allows this camera to capture a quality image even in low light.\" He adds, \"Not all accidents happen in front of you, which is why the RedTiger comes with a rear camera as well. It captures a wide, 140-degree-angle field of view, so you're covered in both the front and rear.

Like its expensive counterparts (Le Creuset, anyone?), it's made of sturdy cast iron, which is an excellent heat retainer.

The sale kicks off on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and runs through Wednesday, Oct. 8. Set a reminder, or you might miss out on this shorter discount window!\n\nWhat will be on sale during Fall Prime Day?\n\nWhile we won't know exact markdowns until the sale begins, previous Prime Day events have been excellent times to score rarely discounted tech for near-record-low or record-low prices. (We're always on the lookout for Apple products in particular.) Seasonal clothing and style finds are another popular category — grab a winter coat and some boots for less before the first frost! — as well as small home appliances like air fryers, air purifiers and vacuums. It's also a smart time to shop for holiday gifts before the Black Friday rush, and you'll feel so accomplished knowing you've checked off some items from your list before you've even doled out Halloween candy.\n\nDo I need to have an Amazon Prime membership?\n\nHaving an Amazon Prime membership isn't a prerequisite; there are always deals that everyone can enjoy. That said, many of the best Prime Day deals are reserved for Prime members, so having a subscription will allow you to make the most of the sale. Signing up is a cinch, and new members can opt for a free 30-day trial (after which, you'll be charged $139 each year — and you can cancel anytime).\n\nAmazon? It'll be more like Amazin' with all of the savings you'll be scooping up.\n\nIf you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)\n\nShop Prime Day deals: Early October Prime Day 2025 deals | Early Prime Day tech deals | Best credit card for Amazon",

      "title": "The best makeup removers for mature skin in 2025, tested and reviewed",
      "content": "Waking up with remnants of last night's smoky eye or crusty concealer is among my biggest beauty pet peeves. In my mind, I should be rewarded for washing my face before bed after a long day, not punished with raccoon eyes in the morning. While there remains an array of fantastic face washes on the market, the best makeup removers are specially formulated to gently, effortlessly break down ingredients in cosmetics, including stubborn, waterproof formulas. Using a highly effective makeup remover is particularly important as we age. That's because any rough rubbing (with water or even mild face wash) can damage thinner and more delicate mature skin, causing an influx of fine lines and wrinkles, not to mention irritation.\n\nThe world of makeup removal is surprisingly vast and consists of items that may be unfamiliar to many consumers, including cleansing balms, micellar waters, oil-based face washes, makeup wipes and even cleansing \"milks.\" Of these, certain formulas are generally better for over-40 skin like mine that now suffers from a lack of moisture. Since my skin is much drier than it was five years ago (thanks, perimenopause!), some of my harsher go-to makeup removers are no longer right for me. Instead, I've discovered more emollient formulas — those I once avoided because they caused breakouts — are now much more beneficial to soothing and hydrating my older skin.\n\nIt’s not just the annoyance of mascara-ridden eyelids (or dirty pillowcases!) that a good makeup remover can help prevent. Over my years as a beauty writer, dermatologists have told me time and again that keeping skin clean is imperative to overall skin health. Residual makeup can cause clogged pores, breakouts, dryness, irritation and even premature aging. That’s because makeup can trap dirt, debris, and environmental pollutants in the skin, which stresses it out and, in turn, accelerates aging. (We won’t even get into the terrifying possibility of eye infections.) Read on for the best makeup removers of 2025.\n\nTable of contents\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUpdate, August 15, 2025: We checked all product prices and availability. Our number one pick for the best makeup remover remains unchanged.\n\nThe best makeup removers of 2025\n\nBioderma Best makeup remover overall Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water Key ingredients: Fatty acid ester micelles, pharmaceutical-grade water | Benefits: Cleanses skin of makeup and impurities, and mitigates redness, discomfort and dryness | Size: 16.9 oz | Formula type: Micellar water | Skin type: Sensitive and normal It should come as little surprise that the French invented micellar water, a product I consider to be among the best skin care on the market today. For the uninitiated, micellar water is a cleansing solution composed of micelles, which are tiny cleansing oil molecules that work like magnets, attracting and removing dirt, oil, makeup and any other gunk settling into your pores. Unlike a regular face cleanser, you don’t even need water to use it. You soak a cotton pad with the micellar water, gently wipe it over your face and the micelles activate. It’s almost like magic. There are some pretty good micellar waters out there, but of those I've tested, nothing beats the French original: Bioderma Sensibio H2O. It removes makeup and dirt swiftly and is the only micellar water that doesn’t irritate my eyes or make them burn (which, as a heavy-duty liquid eyeliner aficionado, is an absolute deal breaker). I’ve used this product for almost a decade and nothing comes close. I’m not alone in my Sensibio H2O obsession. Celebrities like Tracee Ellis Ross, Victoria Beckham, Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore have all proclaimed their love for the micellar water, with Barrymore once calling it “by far the best makeup remover” she has ever used. Pros Gentle around eyes\n\nFragrance-free and alcohol-free\n\nFormulated for sensitive skin\n\nSwiftly removes makeup with little pressure Cons Need to use cotton pads with product\n\nNot strong enough to remove some liquid lipstick $21 at Amazon\n\nEVE LOM Best makeup remover balm Eve Lom the Original Balm Cleanser Key ingredients: Clove, eucalyptus and Egyptian chamomile oils; cocoa butter | Benefits: Tones and exfoliates skin, removes waterproof makeup, hydrates skin for up to 12 hours after use | Size: 1.6 oz | Formula type: Balm Now that my skin is drier, the harsh foam cleansers I once used to wash my face and remove my makeup are off-limits. These days, I need an oil-based solution, like this rich balm, like this from Eve Lom, which is straight heaven on your skin. It’s made with plant and botanical oils, such as clove, eucalyptus, Egyptian chamomile and cocoa butter. It’s also described as a 5-in-1 product that, aside from cleansing and removing makeup, hydrates, exfoliates and tones the skin. To use, you scoop a small amount (not much is needed, which is great) and rub it into your dry skin. Then, you take the muslin cloth included in the box, soak it with hot water, ring it out, press it onto face and gently wipe away your makeup. It can take a couple of repeat steps of rinsing the cloth, soaking it with warm water and removing the makeup, but it fully cleanses away even my most stubborn mascara and eyeshadows. Another big bonus is that this doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or get into my eyes like other balms. Pros Hydrates skin for up to 12 hours\n\nComes with 100% muslin cloth\n\nNon pore-clogging\n\nFormulated without parabens, phthalates, DEA, MEA, sulphates, synthetic fragrance or colorants\n\nClinically proven to reduce whiteheads and blackheads after 14 days Cons Pricey but a little goes a long way\n\nHas a light, natural fragrance, but is too much for some reviewers $51 at Macy's Explore More Buying Options $60 at Amazon$30 at Nordstrom Rack\n\nMedik8 Best oil-based makeup remover Medik8 Lipid-Balance Cleansing Oil Key ingredients: Safflower oil, moringa extract, linoleic acid and vitamin E | Benefits: Gently dissolves heavy makeup, sunscreen and impurities, nourishes skin barrier and is alcohol and paraben-free | Size: 4.7 oz | Formula type: Oil cleanser As I mentioned with the balm, I really appreciate oil cleansers. However, it’s not just the hydrating aspect; they work hard (yet gentle) at removing heavy makeup. This oil cleanser has become a mainstay in my makeup-removal routine. I’m able to cleanse off both heavy eyeliner and waterproof liquid lipstick with it, no problem. The formula is has a ton going for it — it’s made with antioxidant ingredients like moringa extract and vitamin E, as well as fatty acids like safflower oil and omega-6. Which means: All that makeup is coming off my skin, but it’s not stripping it of moisture. Like cleansing balms, oils like this one are applied right onto dry skin. Once you add a drop or two of warm water, the formula emulsifies into a smooth, milky texture. I always feel like I’m “treating” my skin when I’m using this makeup remover. Also, it lasts forever! Yes, it’s a bit pricey at almost $40, but you'll be using it for literal months. Pros Removes waterproof makeup and sunscreen\n\nNo artificial fragrance or synthetic colors\n\nCertified vegan\n\nLuxurious texture Cons A little pricey (but lasts a long time)\n\nMade with essential oils which some people are sensitive to $38 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $38 at Dermstore\n\n(back to top)\n\nA glimpse at my makeup remover testing, including products from Naturium, Eve Lom, Caudalie, Garnier, Medik8, Eadem, Bioderma and Renée Rouleau (Marie Lodi)\n\nHow we tested makeup removers\n\nTo find the best makeup removers, I used my over-decade-long expertise as a beauty editor and my 30-something years of experience wearing makeup (I, ahem, technically wore lipstick in the first grade). After applying a full face of makeup — foundation, concealer, eye makeup, a highly pigmented lip tint) — I tested at least a dozen different makeup removers over three weeks, from micellar waters to cleansing balms and everything in between. I rated each based on efficacy (did it remove even my heaviest eye makeup with ease?), ingredients (is it clean?), formula quality, texture and feel (was it gentle on my eyes?). I also noted the value and whether it was worth a higher price or it was a quality budget buy.\n\n(back to top)\n\nOther makeup removers we tested that didn't make the cut\n\nGarnier Micellar Cleansing Water: Now, I’m sure people (other beauty editors) might argue with me for not putting Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water on this list — it’s extremely popular and has almost 40,000 five-star Amazon reviews! However, while it is effective at removing makeup, it burns my eyes (even the sensitive version), which is why Bioderma Sensibio is my No. 1 pick.\n\nNeutrogena Make-Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes: These makeup wipes like are classic (and good to have with you for emergencies), but I don’t find them as effective at removing an entire face of makeup as the other types of products listed here, not to mention the incredible amount of waste they create.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n(back to top)\n\nMakeup remover FAQs\n\nWhat is the best way to remove waterproof mascara?\n\nWaterproof mascara and lipsticks are formulated to last hours (sometimes even more than 24 hours!). It’s impressive, especially if you’ve ever tried to remove these products with a regular face wash without success. Oil-based makeup removers or cleansing balms are the most effective for breaking down waterproof formulas. This is because they can draw out other oil-based debris, like makeup. Depending on the oil cleanser, you may have to follow up with a second cleanser, which you’ll learn about below.\n\nDo I need to double-cleanse when removing makeup?\n\nIf I haven’t stressed this enough: It’s absolutely important to remove all your makeup before bed. If you’re still seeing remnants of makeup or find that your makeup remover feels too oily, a double-cleansing routine can be beneficial. First, use your makeup remover, then follow up with a mild face cleanser to dissolve any leftover residue and ensure your skin is completely clean.\n\nWhat type of makeup remover is best for my skin type?\n\nNot all makeup removers are the same. For dry skin, look for hydrating options like oil-based cleansers, balms or a cream cleanser with moisturizing ingredients. If your skin is oily, a gel-based makeup remover might be best. You can also search for labels that contain “non-comedogenic.” Sensitive skin types should look for formulas that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free and free of harsh ingredients.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe received complimentary samples of some products and purchased others ourselves, but we reviewed all products using the same objective criteria.\n\n(back to top)",

In my mind, I should be rewarded for washing my face before bed after a long day, not punished with raccoon eyes in the morning.

      "content": "Key takeaways:\n\nDRC’s export suspension and new quotas from October 16 are set to create a near-term supply gap for China just as seasonal demand rises.\n\nChinese cobalt refiners are switching from scarce hydroxide to dissolving cobalt metal, supported by favorable economics despite operational hurdles.\n\nPrices are surging: cobalt sulfate has jumped and Chinese cobalt metal has rallied as refiners stock up, signaling tighter markets ahead.\n\nChinese cobalt supply squeeze as DRC extends suspension\n\nThe DRC has extended its cobalt export suspension and will introduce a quota system from October 16. With shipments typically taking around three months to reach China, refiners anticipate a gap in supply just as seasonal demand for cobalt sulfate and tetroxide picks up in September and October.\n\nChinese cobalt refiners pivot to metal amid hydroxide tightness\n\nSpot cobalt hydroxide has become increasingly difficult to procure with the current price surge. Cobalt metal, with relatively higher inventories and more competitive prices compared with hydroxide at present, has emerged as a practical substitute.\n\nSeveral Chinese smelters have purchased metal in preparation, while one major producer told Fastmarkets it has already adjusted its production line to accommodate metal dissolution. Other refiners said similar preparations are under way.\n\n“We are preparing to melt cobalt metal. It has become an unavoidable option given the long shipping cycle for new hydroxide and the high costs of current feedstock,” a cobalt smelter source said.\n\nAnother producer said the cost differential was attractive enough to justify the switch, and that the dissolution of cobalt metal would better accommodate their long-term orders for cobalt sulfate because their cobalt hydroxide inventories are running low.\n\nPrice signals and Chinese cobalt economics for dissolution\n\nFastmarkets’ twice-weekly price assessment for cobalt sulfate 20.5% Co basis, exw China was 65,000-70,000 yuan ($9,112-9,812) per tonne on Friday, up by 3,000-6,000 yuan per tonne (7.14%) from 62,000-64,000 yuan per tonne on Thursday and up from 58,000-60,000 yuan per tonne on September 19.\n\nBased on this level, sources said cobalt metal purchased within the range of 260,000-290,000 yuan per tonne could be profitably dissolved into sulfate. Some refiners said they had already stocked metal in advance for this purpose to capture the spread, and some said they have prepared for further increases in cobalt sulfate production.\n\nOperational hurdles: Dissolution lines, formats and timing\n\nDissolving cobalt metal into sulfate, however, has not previously been a common practice. Few smelters have dedicated production lines in place for this process. One major producer said it had facilities designed for briquette but noted that cobalt cathode – the form of metal more readily available in the market – is harder to dissolve and less efficient to handle.\n\nSources also mentioned that the dissolution process can be lengthy. One producer told Fastmarkets the turnaround time to process cobalt metal into usable sulfate can take around two weeks, compared with a faster cycle using hydroxide.\n\nThis extended processing time could limit how much smelters can rely on metal feedstock in the near term, despite the current economic incentives, sources said.\n\nChinese cobalt metal prices rally on shift in feedstock\n\nThe prospect of refiners turning to metal has also contributed to a sharp rally in cobalt metal prices.\n\nFastmarkets’ twice-weekly price assessment for cobalt, 99.8% Co min, ex-works China, was 316,000-325,000 yuan per tonne on Friday September 26, up by 8.09% from 290,000-303,000 yuan per tonne on Wednesday, and from 271,000-282,000 yuan prior to the quota announcement.\n\nMarket outlook: Sentiment, inventories and further tightness\n\n“We’ve seen prices rise rapidly as the market digests the quota system and as new supply remains constrained. I expect in the short term that prices will not come down easily, given the bullish sentiment across the market,” a trader said.\n\n“I see smelters preparing to dissolve metal as a turning point. It signals that hydroxide inventories are nearly depleted and that more refiners will have no choice but to turn to metal. This will only tighten the market further and keep prices on an upward trajectory,” a second trader said.\n\nWhat’s next for the global cobalt industry?

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. -- PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Five years after protests roiled Portland, Oregon, the city known for its history of civil disobedience is again at the center of a political maelstrom as it braces for the arrival of federal troops being deployed by President Donald Trump.\n\nMonths of demonstrations outside Portland's immigration detention facility have escalated since Trump said last week he was sending federal troops to the city, which he described as “War ravaged.” Police made a few arrests late Thursday after fights broke out in the crowd, including of conservative influencer Nick Sortor on a disorderly conduct charge.\n\nOn Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency would send additional federal agents and the Justice Department was launching a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding Sortor’s arrest, and whether the Portland Police Bureau engages in viewpoint discrimination.\n\nCity leaders adamantly deny any such discrimination and said they don't need the National Guard to help handle the single block outside the ICE facility where the protests have occurred.\n\n“Last night, the arrests that we made, we made based upon probable cause, not based upon individuals,” Police Chief Bob Day told a news conference Friday. “There is no political bias associated with our enforcement.”\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge heard arguments — but did not immediately rule — on whether to temporarily block Trump's call-up of 200 Oregon National Guard members, which the administration said is needed to protect the ICE facility and other federal buildings.\n\nThe escalation of federal law enforcement in Portland, population 636,000 and Oregon's largest city, follows similar crackdowns to combat crime in other cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Memphis. He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.\n\nSortor, 27, who's a regular guest on Fox News and whose X profile has more than 1 million followers, was arrested Thursday night with two other people outside the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office said it was reviewing the case and would make a decision on whether to proceed with charges before Sortor's arraignment Monday.\n\nWhat led to the arrests was not immediately clear. Portland police said they moved into the crowd to make arrests as fights broke out. They arrested Sorter and two others.\n\nAll three were charged with second-degree disorderly conduct. Sorter was released Friday on his own recognizance, according to Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office’s online records. An email seeking comment from Sortor sent Friday went unanswered and no one answered phone numbers listed for him.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday morning, Sortor said his arrest proved that Portland Police are corrupt and controlled by “vioIent Antifa thugs who terrorize the streets.”\n\nPortland famously erupted in more than 100 days of sustained, nightly protests in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement. In his first term, Trump sent federal law enforcement to the city to protect the U.S. District Courthouse in the heart of Portland after protests attracted thousands of people following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police.\n\nThe presence of the federal agents further inflamed the situation, with federal officers repeatedly firing rubber bullets and teargassing protestors. Viral videos captured militarized federal officers, often unidentified, arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles.\n\nAt the same time, Portland police were unable to keep ahead of splinter groups of black-clad protesters who broke off and roamed the downtown area, at times breaking windows, spraying graffiti and setting small fires in moments that were also captured on video and shared widely on social media.\n\nA report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment needed to carry out the mission.\n\nThe tensions reached a peak in September 2020 when a self-identified member of the far-left anti-fascist movement fatally shot 39-year-old Aaron “Jay” Danielson in the chest. Danielson and a friend were seen heading downtown to protect a flag-waving caravan of Trump supporters shortly before the shooting.\n\nThe shooter, Michael Forest Reinoehl, was himself later shot and killed when he pulled a gun as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him near Lacey, Washington.\n\nThe situation in Portland is very different now.\n\nThere's been a sustained and low-level protest outside the ICE facility — far from the downtown clashes of 2020 — since Trump took office in January. Those protests flared in June, during the national protests surrounding Trump's military parade, but have rarely attracted more than a few dozen people in the past two months.\n\nTrump has once more turned his attention to the city, calling Portland “war ravaged,” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.” But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020. Under a new mayor, the city has reduced crime, and the downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments and increased foot traffic.\n\nMost violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nCity leaders have urged restraint and told residents not to “take the bait” this week after the announcement that the National Guard would be sent to Portland.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments on whether to block the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland, where they would defend federal buildings such as the ICE facility from vandalism.\n\nOregon sued to stop the deployment on Sept. 28 after Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek failed to persuade Trump to call off the deployment in a phone call a day earlier.\n\nImmergut said she would rule later Friday or over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Guard troops — from communities not too far from Portland — were training on the Oregon Coast in anticipation of deployment.\n\nThursday's arrest of Sortor, however, likely means more federal law enforcement presence in Portland.\n\nIn an X post, which reposted a video from the protest and a photo of Sortor being detained, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said there would be an immediate increase in federal resources to the city with enhanced Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement resources.\n\n“This violence will end under @POTUS Trump,” McLaughlin wrote.",

      "title": "Why U.S. politicians keep #$%& swearing",
      "content": "In his address to the top U.S. military officials in Virginia earlier this week, War Secretary Pete Hegseth let it be known that the Trump administration is \"done with that shit.\"\n\nHe was referring to the so-called \"woke culture\" that he said had infiltrated the military.\n\nThat a curse word would be used so intentionally and publicly by such a senior political figure is something that would have seemed out of place not too long ago.\n\nBut such colourful language among U.S. politicians, particularly during the Trump administrations, seems more commonplace.\n\nTrump himself, who may have toned down his public cursing since entering the presidential race a decade ago, still can let some expletives fly. Indeed, he made political history in June when he became the first president to publicly drop an F-bomb when expressing frustration over the Israel/Iran conflict.\n\nBoth countries \"have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f--k they're doing,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nWATCH | Trump drops F-bomb: Trump says he's 'not happy' with Israel or Iran, says they ‘don’t know what the f--k they are doing' Duration 0:52 U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking Tuesday as he was leaving for a NATO meeting, expressed displeasure with both Israel and Iran: 'We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f--k they're doing.'\n\nVice-President JD Vance has also not been shy about cursing, although much of it seems relegated to social media. Just last month, Vance referred to former Obama aide turned popular podcaster Jon Favreau as a \"dipshit\" regarding his comments about the shooting at an immigration detention centre.\n\nThe gunman had anti-ICE messaging carved on the bullets he used. What, precisely, did I get wrong, dipshit? <a href=\"https://t.co/XRtFm4vdVB\">https://t.co/XRtFm4vdVB</a> —@JDVance\n\nThe current administration \"is more comfortable perhaps with being more confrontational and therefore using language that would be seen as being more confrontational and more problematic than perhaps other politicians,\" said Roger Kreuz, a psychology professor specializing in linguistics at the University of Memphis.\n\nBut Democrats are no slouches in the potty-mouth department, and, as some recent headlines have observed, seem to be making a conscious effort to show that they can curse with the best of them.\n\nAsked in August by the popular newsletter Parnas Perspective about Trump extending control over the D.C. police, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded: \"No f--king way.\"\n\nBack in April, a number of Democratic hopefuls ran on a pledge to \"unf--k our country\" and that the party would \"drop the excuses and grow a f‑‑king spine.\"\n\nIt’s official: I’m running for Congress.<br><br>I’ve spent my career holding the powerful accountable as a political and legal journalist. I’m running for Congress to tell you the truth, to fight for New York…and to Unf*ck Our Country.<br><br>Join my campaign: <a href=\"https://t.co/JJKPtAsiwB\">https://t.co/JJKPtAsiwB</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EEwtb9d9io\">pic.twitter.com/EEwtb9d9io</a> —@MikeSacksEsq\n\nSen. Adam Schiff said in March on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that Trump \"can go f--k himself.\"\n\nAnd last month, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told an audience at New York University that if she and her fellow Democrats are \"not helping people we should go the f--k home.\"\n\nWATCH | Hegseth curses in speech to top brass: Secretary of War Pete Hegseth curses in speech to top military brass Duration 0:57 U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said the Trump administration is 'done with that shit,' in a speech declaring the end of 'woke' culture to top U.S. military officials at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Va.\n\nMichael Adams, a provost professor of English at Indiana University Bloomington, whose books include In Praise of Profanity, compares today's political curse culture to the George W. Bush administration. Back in 2004, it was a big political incident when Vice-President Dick Cheney was caught on mic telling Sen. Patrick Leahy: \"Go f--k yourself.\"\n\nAlthough Cheney never disavowed the comment, and later said it was one of his proudest moments, it also wasn't meant for public consumption.\n\nBack then, \"everybody was swearing, but pretty much everybody was careful not to swear where they'd be heard publicly,\" Adams said.\n\nBut when the Trump campaign rolled in around 2015 to 2016, all that changed, as Trump cared not a whit if the public heard him swear, Adams says.\n\nAnd that became a problem for Democrats.\n\n\"They could see that that type of language was being interpreted as sort of the willingness not to follow the rules, because following the rules gets you to the status quo,\" said Adams, and back then voters wanted \"a big change.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer dropped his own F-bomb in August, referring to Donald Trump's plans to use troops in Washington, D.C. (Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press)\n\nWith both political teams now spewing expletives in public, the U.S. has entered an era in which profanity isn't just tolerated, it's campaign strategy, wrote columnist Christian Schneider recently for National Review.\n\n\"When politicians across the spectrum swear these days, it's not a slip on a hot mic but on purpose, part of their brand,\" he wrote. \"They curse not because they've lost their temper. They curse because their social media team ran the numbers.\"\n\nStill, Andrew Bates, a past aide to former U.S. president Joe Biden, says some of that cussing comes from genuine frustration.\n\n\"The truth is that [politicians] are driven by the same things most people are — like anger at honest folks being denied a fair shot — and we need to prove it by showing fight,\" he told Politico in March.\n\nCaitlin Legacki, a Democratic campaign veteran, also told Politico that the key to swearing well, is not to over do it, nor force it.\n\n\"If elected officials are going to cuss, they have to mean it. If it's authentic to who they are and how they're feeling, voters will probably be fine with it and even relate to it,\" she said.\n\n\"But if it's not authentic, there's nothing more cringe-worthy.\"\n\nSo far, the profanity train doesn't seem to have rolled into the Canadian political landscape. Of course, Canada's elected officials have from time to time been caught cursing, though more often it's not a planned public utterance, but during heated debate in the House of Commons.\n\nPossibly the most famous, or infamous, was in 1971, when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau ruffled some feathers after allegedly dropping an F-bomb during one especially rancorous debate. He later insisted he had used the word \"fuddle-duddle.\"\n\nPerhaps the closest recent thing to public cursing was last year's YouTube video by Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. The video was titled \"I Call BS\" and criticized the Trudeau government over housing costs. (Only the initials were used, and the full curse word never spoken.)\n\nWhether this U.S. political swear trend will make its way north is hard to say. But it's doubtful it will be leaving American politics anytime soon.\n\n\"I'm not sure that you can really stop that,\" Adams said. \"I don't think that swearing is going to go away generally. If we accept that politicians are going to be part of general culture then we won't be surprised when they're swearing.\"",

      "content": "The world’s biggest independent oil trader, Vitol, has appointed Douglas Booth as head of copper concentrates . He is the third trader to join the company’s revived metals team so far this year. The move continues the build-out of Vitol’s metals team. It follows the recruitment of Bruno Porto as head of copper in March and the addition of Adrien de Sousa as trader in the refined copper team in June.\n\nNew appointments strengthen team\n\nBooth announced his move on LinkedIn on October 1. He joins from IXM in Geneva where he had worked as a senior copper trader since early 2023.\n\nPrior to IXM, Booth spent more than 12 years at Glencore as a senior copper trader at the company’s Baar headquarters in Switzerland.\n\nDe Sousa joined from SEFE Marketing & Trading. He had been senior vice president of energy transition metals and minerals in Singapore since October 2024.\n\n\n\nPrior to SEFE, de Sousa spent almost 10 years at Mitsubishi Corporation RtM International in Singapore. There, he served as general manager of the refined metal division and carbon from April 2020 to October 2024. He also served as lead aluminium trader from March 2015 to March 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before Mitsubishi, de Sousa was a senior aluminium trader at Norway’s Norsk Hydro.\n\nPorto joined Vitol after 18 years at Glencore.\n\nHow Vitol copper business is evolving beyond energy markets\n\nVitol’s expansion into copper comes as energy traders increasingly move into the metals markets. They are capitalizing on profits earned during the volatility in energy markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to media reports.\n\nAt a conference in April 2024, Vitol chief executive officer Russell Hardy confirmed that the oil giant was starting to rebuild a metals trading book after a long absence from the market. He described it as “a relatively small addition to our business” with an “exciting decade” ahead.\n\nThe company previously traded metals through Euromin in the 1990s but exited the business after struggling with risk management. Hardy said that Vitol was now starting from scratch again.\n\nBeyond copper, Vitol has also expanded into iron ore and aluminium trading in recent years. They hired traders from Glencore and other competitors.\n\nVitol copper trading strategy shows cautious long-term outlook\n\nMarket participants told Fastmarkets that Vitol’s approach in building a copper trading book was more cautious but also more progressive than other new entrants.\n\nThe company is leveraging its extensive balance sheet and market relationships built over the decades in energy trading. Vitol is gradually expanding into copper concentrates, Fastmarkets understands. Sources have characterized Vitol’s strategy as a “three-to-five year project,” reflecting its more long-term view than competitors such as Mercuria which moved aggressively into the metals space earlier this year.\n\nFastmarkets assessed the copper concentrates TC index, cif Asia Pacific – the mid-point between smelter and trader buying levels – at $(63.40) per tonne on Friday September 26. This was down by $0.10 per tonne from $(63.30) per tonne on September 19.",

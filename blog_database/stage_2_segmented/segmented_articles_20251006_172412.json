Whether you love to hit the slopes and trails, work outside in frigid temps, have poor circulation or are simply always cold, these cozy companions are the perfect solution for icy feet.\n\n\n\nThese high-tech socks boast built-in heating elements to provide gentle, consistent warmth, ensuring your tootsies stay nice and toasty.

I was able to slip these on with ease, and they fit seamlessly into bulky snow boots and sneakers. In addition to a comfy cushioned heel, they boast incredibly thin, flexible infrared fiber heating elements that didn't cause discomfort. The socks were warm even without the heating, and while they did go up very high on my calves, they didn't dig in like others I tested. They warmed up very quickly, and I loved that they heat the top and bottom of your foot and your toes — other socks I tested heat just the top or bottom. I could switch between three heating levels by pushing the button built in at the top of the sock. The button color changes between blue, white and red to let you know which level you're on. The battery packs were incredibly slim and fit in the socks' pockets seamlessly. Plus, these socks came with a wall plug that made charging the battery easy. Pros Comfortable\n\nCushioned heel\n\nThin, flexible heating elements\n\nEasy to use and charge Cons Pricey $80 at Amazon\n\n(back to top)\n\nMore top heated socks we recommend\n\nRebecca Carhart/Yahoo Most comfortable heated socks Ororo Heated Socks Size range: S-XL | Temperature range: 95°F-122°F | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Material: Cotton, CoolMax, spandex The heating component here is top-notch, with carbon fibers that wrap around your soles to provide ample warmth. You can choose from three heat levels and use the handy pocket at the top of the sock to store the battery, which will last up to 11 hours on the lowest setting — impressive. I loved that these got warm very quickly, and while the heating element is only on the bottom of the sock, it kept my entire foot warm and toasty. The socks were very soft and cozy, and I loved how cushioned they were, which made them even more comfortable than expected. I ordered a size medium and they fit perfectly: They weren't loose but still didn't dig in at all. I also liked the curved shape of the battery, which helped it lie comfortably against my calf when in the pocket. What's more, the socks were breathable and moisture-wicking, so my feet stayed dry even as they got very warm. Pros Incredibly soft and comfy\n\nImpressive battery life\n\nEasy to use\n\nMoisture-wicking Cons Expensive $110 at Amazon\n\nRebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best heated socks with remote Dr. Warm Wireless Heated Socks Size range: S-XL | Temperature range: 95°F-149°F | Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Material: Cotton, acrylic, nylon, spandex If you don't feel like pulling up your snow pants (don't even get us started on thermal underwear) every time you need to adjust the temperature on your heated socks, check out this pair that comes with a handy remote control. I love that it can clip onto your jacket or gloves so you won't lose it. I was able to get near-instant satisfaction with these socks; they start heating up in just 30 seconds. The battery lasts up to eight hours on the lowest setting. I loved that the heating elements wrapped around the top and bottom of my foot and warmed up fast. As for the fit, these socks did dig into the top of my calves a bit, so you may want to go up a size if that would bother you a lot. I also found them a bit scratchy in the toe area compared with others, but the ease of the remote and quick heating capabilities still helped make them one of my favorites. Pros Easy to control with included remote\n\nStrong battery life\n\nWarm up quickly Cons Pricey\n\nA little scratchy $76 at Amazon\n\nRebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best for fast heat Snow Deer Rechargeable Electric Heated Socks Size range: S-XL | Temperature range: 100°F-131°F | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Material: CoolMax, elastic, spandex With three heat settings and an easy-peasy one-touch control panel built into the top of the sock, it's no wonder these are among Amazon's most popular pairs of heated socks. The battery will last up to 10 hours, but if you're planning an all-day ice capade with nary an outlet in sight, you may want to purchase backup batteries. The socks are made from a moisture-wicking poly that, according to the brand, dries five times faster than cotton, and they kept my feet nice and dry. They got my feet very warm incredibly quickly, and I liked that the control panel not only lets you change the temperature settings but also shows you the battery level, so you know when you need to recharge. While the socks are soft and cozy, I did find the fit of the mediums a bit weird. They were loose on the foot but tight on the calf, so I would recommend paying close attention to the sizing chart. Pros Easy to use\n\nMoisture-wicking\n\nWarm up quickly Cons Fit may be off for some $80 at Amazon\n\nRebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best heated insoles Thermrup Electric Heated Insoles Size range: One size fits all | Battery life: Up to 6 hours | Material: Polyester Prefer to wear your go-to favorite socks, but still want to add some heat to your feet? Try a heated insole. Hundreds of Amazon shoppers love this option from Thermrup because the insoles warm up the entire bottom of your foot with four levels of heat to choose from. After testing them, I fully understood why they were so popular. The one-size-fits-all insoles are marked by size, so it was easy to trim them down to fit my shoes. They kept the bottoms of my feet super warm, but they did take a few minutes to warm up fully. Since these are insoles and not socks, you will need to wear the included gaiters to house the battery packs. Pros Customizable fit\n\nEasy to use\n\nYou can wear your own tried-and-true socks Cons Take a bit of time to warm up\n\nSome may find battery gaiters annoying $70 at Amazon\n\n(back to top)\n\nWhat to look for when choosing heated socks\n\n\"It is important to look for socks that have multiple heat settings as well as meet the proper electrical safety standards,\" Canuso says. When you get a pair to try, you'll want to ensure the heating coils are fully insulated in the sock and not sticking out at all, as you don't want them to come in direct contact with your skin. The socks should also have adjustable heat settings to give you control over the temperature, and you'll want to make sure the batteries used are high-quality and don't overheat when charging. Other considerations include the following:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBattery life: Check out how long the battery can keep your socks juiced up, \"especially if you are planning on sleeping with the socks on or wearing them for longer than four hours,\" Canuso says.\n\n\n\nMaterial: While cotton and fleece socks are great for lounging around the house, outdoor activities like skiing, hunting or hiking are more demanding. You might want to look for breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester, nylon and wool to keep your feet dry and happy while you're active.\n\n\n\nTemperature range: Depending on the pair, heated socks can have settings that range from 86°F to 158°F. Be sure to read the product description to find a pair that fits your temperature needs.\n\n(back to top)\n\nHow we tested\n\nWe tested 10 of the most popular heated socks to see which are actually worth buying. (Rebecca Carhart/Yahoo)\n\nTo figure out which heated socks were the best of the best, we consulted Canuso to get the scoop on what to look for when picking out the right pair for your needs. We then combed through hundreds of shopper reviews to see which pairs outdoor enthusiasts wear themselves — and then tested 10 of the most popular pairs to see which ones are actually worth buying.\n\n(back to top)\n\nOther heated socks we tested\n\nSun Will: The front foot and instep feature heating coils to keep your toes nice and toasty, while the heels are lightly cushioned to treat your feet. These were warm and cozy, but they were nearly identical to the Savior Heat heated socks in design and comfort. That said, they lacked the larger temperature range of Savior Heat.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nActionHeat: If taking a break to recharge batteries isn't an option, this pair of heated socks runs on good ol' AAs. You will need a total of six AA batteries for both socks. Unfortunately, I had trouble getting them to work. The battery packs would turn red, suggesting that the batteries had juice, but when I plugged them into the socks, they never turned on.\n\nAutocastle: This pair fit comfortably and looked nice (we tested the hot pink), but they took longer to warm up than other options on our list. The brand does recommend turning them to the highest setting in the first five to 15 minutes, then switching to lower heat settings for the best results. It definitely helped when we did that, but they still took longer than others.\n\nHotronic: We ordered a pair of these to test after seeing them on a few other best heated sock lists. Well, turns out they're not actually heated — just a normal pair of warm socks. Whoops!\n\n(back to top)\n\nHeated socks FAQs\n\nHow do heated socks work?\n\nFashion meets function in these innovative accessories. While they may look like run-of-the-mill foot coverings, heated socks contain ultrathin, flexible heating elements that are usually made from carbon fiber or other conductive materials. These wires are strategically woven into the fabric of the sock, usually focusing on the areas where your feet might need extra warmth, like the toes. Heated socks are typically a snap to use; most have an attached control panel so you can easily adjust heating levels to suit your needs. Some of the newer, more high-tech versions come with wireless remotes or smartphone apps that let you adjust the temperature.\n\nAre heated socks safe?\n\nIf the socks are from a reputable company and meet all safety standards, they're generally safe for most users. However, Canuso recommends not wearing heated socks if you are neuropathic. \"The concern arises when the wearer of the socks suffers from a degree of neuropathy and cannot feel the heat from the socks. In this situation, the wearer could be unaware that the socks are burning them if they become too hot,\" she explained.\n\nCan you wash heated socks in the washing machine?\n\nIt's always best to read care instructions for each pair. While many are machine-washable, you always have to remove the battery before washing them and should let them air-dry in most cases. Many reviewers say that even if the brand said the socks were machine-washable, they still hand-washed them just to be safe.\n\nWhat happens if heated socks get wet?\n\nIt's always best to let heated socks air-dry. And even if the sock is water-resistant, the batteries shouldn't be exposed to water, so avoid getting them wet when the batteries are still attached.\n\n(back to top)",

        "Rebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best heated socks with remote Dr. Warm Wireless Heated Socks Size range: S-XL | Temperature range: 95°F-149°F | Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Material: Cotton, acrylic, nylon, spandex If you don't feel like pulling up your snow pants (don't even get us started on thermal underwear) every time you need to adjust the temperature on your heated socks, check out this pair that comes with a handy remote control. I love that it can clip onto your jacket or gloves so you won't lose it. I was able to get near-instant satisfaction with these socks; they start heating up in just 30 seconds. The battery lasts up to eight hours on the lowest setting. I loved that the heating elements wrapped around the top and bottom of my foot and warmed up fast. As for the fit, these socks did dig into the top of my calves a bit, so you may want to go up a size if that would bother you a lot. I also found them a bit scratchy in the toe area compared with others, but the ease of the remote and quick heating capabilities still helped make them one of my favorites. Pros Easy to control with included remote",
        "Rebecca Carhart/Yahoo Best for fast heat Snow Deer Rechargeable Electric Heated Socks Size range: S-XL | Temperature range: 100°F-131°F | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Material: CoolMax, elastic, spandex With three heat settings and an easy-peasy one-touch control panel built into the top of the sock, it's no wonder these are among Amazon's most popular pairs of heated socks. The battery will last up to 10 hours, but if you're planning an all-day ice capade with nary an outlet in sight, you may want to purchase backup batteries. The socks are made from a moisture-wicking poly that, according to the brand, dries five times faster than cotton, and they kept my feet nice and dry. They got my feet very warm incredibly quickly, and I liked that the control panel not only lets you change the temperature settings but also shows you the battery level, so you know when you need to recharge. While the socks are soft and cozy, I did find the fit of the mediums a bit weird. They were loose on the foot but tight on the calf, so I would recommend paying close attention to the sizing chart. Pros Easy to use",

Thankfully, though, fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have taken on such a mammoth task on Reddit, and the entries they've included make us want to go all the way back to when Tony Stark got to work in a cave with just a box of scraps.\n\nFrom the bombastic to the brief, plenty of scenes got their flowers on the thread, beginning with one of the many spectacular Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) moments that we saw during his time in the MCU. \"Cap behind the train in Infinity War,\" wrote one fan, which, now having read that, should have you humming his theme tune involuntarily because it was easily one of his coolest moments. The other, of course, was when we found out he was worthy.\n\n\"Mjolnir returning to Cap after he threw it at Thanos, then beating the snot out of him for a minute and a half like he’s been swinging Mjolnir for a thousand years like Thor,\" wrote one fan. It seemed that the trusty hammer has been at the center of many hair-raising moments, though, as another fan included \"Vision handing Mjolinr to Thor\" in Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nWhile the obvious pick was the \"on your left\" portal scene in Avengers: Endgame, another fan compiled a collection of honorable mentions saying, \"Thor showing up with Rocket and Groot, Cap picking up Mjolnir, and Tony’s ‘and I am Iron Man’. The Smells Like Teen Spirit cover scene in Black Widow, too. And honorable honorable mention is probably Kate and Clint back to back shooting at Rockefeller at the end of Hawkeye.\" To which another voter agreed that, \"all of these are the correct answer.\"\n\nWho knows just how many might be added to the list when Avengers: Doomsday arrives next year. For now, though, why not check out our list of the best Marvel movie moments here.",

        "If we were asked to compile some of the best goosebump-inducing moments in the MCU, we could do it all day. Thankfully, though, fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have taken on such a mammoth task on Reddit, and the entries they've included make us want to go all the way back to when Tony Stark got to work in a cave with just a box of scraps.",
        "From the bombastic to the brief, plenty of scenes got their flowers on the thread, beginning with one of the many spectacular Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) moments that we saw during his time in the MCU. \"Cap behind the train in Infinity War,\" wrote one fan, which, now having read that, should have you humming his theme tune involuntarily because it was easily one of his coolest moments. The other, of course, was when we found out he was worthy.",
        "\"Mjolnir returning to Cap after he threw it at Thanos, then beating the snot out of him for a minute and a half like he’s been swinging Mjolnir for a thousand years like Thor,\" wrote one fan. It seemed that the trusty hammer has been at the center of many hair-raising moments, though, as another fan included \"Vision handing Mjolinr to Thor\" in Avengers: Age of Ultron.",
        "While the obvious pick was the \"on your left\" portal scene in Avengers: Endgame, another fan compiled a collection of honorable mentions saying, \"Thor showing up with Rocket and Groot, Cap picking up Mjolnir, and Tony’s ‘and I am Iron Man’. The Smells Like Teen Spirit cover scene in Black Widow, too. And honorable honorable mention is probably Kate and Clint back to back shooting at Rockefeller at the end of Hawkeye.\" To which another voter agreed that, \"all of these are the correct answer.\"",
        "Who knows just how many might be added to the list when Avengers: Doomsday arrives next year. For now, though, why not check out our list of the best Marvel movie moments here."

      "content": "Reaktion Books\n\ncaught up with Liam Cagney, a musicologist and author of new book , to discuss early musical influences, the state of the city's club scene in 2025 and the mythos around the vaunted Friedrichshain power plant.I grew up in rural Donegal. My dad listened to Leadbelly and read. My older siblings were raving. I absorbed it and resolved to grow up and take LSD. When I started getting into music as a teenager I hoovered up theand, and obsessively watched old VHS tapes of MTV's. My bachelor's degree in Dublin was a joint major in English and music that helped cleave my head open. I became a music journalist, played in a noise band and did a PhD on spectral music. The academy spat me out and I ended up in Berlin.My relationship with Berghain has been on/off since 2006. Flowers, fallings-out, sexy weekend breaks. One night in 2006 a group of us were brought there by a friend (stylist Jackie Taylor). The techno floor was 99-percent gay men and the club mostly German-speaking. It felt like the last days of imperial Rome. I went again twice when I briefly lived in Berlin in 2010. Then when I moved back to Berlin in 2016, I started going regularly and became obsessed. I realised I was going there to figure out why I was going there, an exercise in circular reasoning. Later I learned I was neurodivergent, as is half the club.I've been writing fiction for years. I was shortlisted for the White Review Short Story Prize in 2017. It gave me the confidence to write a literary book. There's an Annie Dillard quote I like: 'You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.' It felt about time someone for posterity wrote a book about Berghain, to bear witness to whatever it is or was. Don't people nowadays love reading accounts of The Loft and 1970s Fire Island? It also felt like people rarely actually wrote about the music there, which I was in a good position to do. 'Techno is a mode of address,' was what I eventually arrived at in. Hence the book's Sun Ra epigraph. Afro grooves, Xenakis weirdness. I tried to trace how it evolved and what it might mean.Paul citing Syd Barrett and walking out of the club in 2006. Emma and I smoking many cigarettes together in 2010. Carl Craig playing a wanky set in Panorama Bar in December 2017 only to be blown away afterwards by Omar S. Korridor moaning into the microphone over 7/4 beats one Sunday morning in 2019. Beaming glitterballs as Eris Drew and Octo Octa played 2022 CSD weekend. Honey Dijon the same day transforming the main room into a giant instrument in a relentless jacking groove. Xin's many friends in the toilet cubicle. David Lynchian Dasha Rush before a red curtain in Halle one Silvester. Brett sitting cross-legged before me and me asking him, 'What do you think of Berghain?,' and Brett bursting out laughing and simply replying, 'Berghain is Berghain,' a perfect zen response. Finding myself standing beside the owner one Sunday and wondering whether I should say something and then thinking better of it and keeping my mouth shut.My book explores other Berlin parties and clubs as well. I'm suspicious of people who only go clubbing at Berghain. It's a conservatism to which I can't relate (Ni Dieu, ni maître). Sherø played a wonderful house set at the not-actually-final Horse Meat Disco Berlin last year. Discodromo were always agreeably psychedelic and I remember the fun of dancing to their set for the Cocktail d'Amore tenth birthday party at Griessmuehle. Simon and myself in a grotty Lichtenberg warehouse one Sunday morning with sunlight pouring in and some young DJ who wasn't on the bill deciding to jump behind the decks, blasting out a gabber set with all of us party stragglers spontaneously jumping around doing silly dancing, such fun. Or if you want a Berghain one, Oscar Mulero in 2022 and 2025, molten as the core of some weird planet.Yes. I've been going there much less. I'm not sure whether you can take Berghain on its own without seeing its silence within the context of the Germany state's broader moral failure. On the other hand, I find it hard to be on a dance floor around Germany-based white liberals who want to keep partying and pretending that they've got no moral responsibility towards the victims of the genocide that their taxpayer income is funding. It disgusted me. When you grow up in Ireland you know a bit about colonialism. My great-grandfather was murdered in front of his family in 1922. I could go on. All that said, as tempting as it is to launch into shaming or insulting people for having the wrong opinion, as far as political organisation goes, these days I feel trying gentle persuasion is more effective. As Emma Dabiri and many others have noted, the only way we will effect significant political change is to create coalitions across identity groups rather than doubling down on divisions.I remember going with my friends to an illegal warehouse rave in Berlin in 2008 and the bouncer shaking his head as we entered and saying in English, 'Berlin has changed.' It feels like people have always been saying that. Nonetheless, many clubs are currently in trouble. Seeing Renate, Watergate and SchwuZ all close this year has been really sad, put to the sword by gentrification. There's also the ridiculous A100 motorway project that's threatening other clubs (the motor lobby in Germany is like the gun lobby in the USA). On the other hand, new parties keep popping up and some new clubs. A lot of young ravers these days are going to Pinky Promise, for instance, a party I'd imagine most veteran Berlin clubbers have never heard of. It's also worth remembering that historically clubs tended not to have much of a lifespan. Danceteria lasted six years. Ostgut lasted four. Aside from that, an anecdote. One time we were in a damp basement on Rigaer Strasse with a simple pair of decks, a strobe light and around ten people, and Karin turned to me and said in her direct German way, 'You know, this is how the Berlin club scene started.' That stuck with me. Get off the grid and support smaller parties, smaller clubs and grassroots events.",

      "content": "Every day the calendar ticks closer to the start of October's biggest online sale: Amazon Big Deal Days. This two-day sales event, better known as October Prime Day, happens this week, and it's shaping up to deliver some of the best Prime Day deals of the season.\n\n\n\nForget the kitchen gadgets and robot vacuums for now — this guide is for the tech crowd. If you've ever waxed poetic about which HDR format is better or if your group text regularly devolves into iPhone vs. Android debates, this is where you'll want to pay attention. TVs, laptops, tablets, headphones and AirPods are all on the table, often at prices you don't see outside major shopping holidays.\n\n\n\nMark your calendar: Tuesday, October 7th, and Wednesday, October 8th. Amazon is lining up two full days of rare tech discounts from Apple, Samsung, Sony, Bose and other heavy hitters. We'll be tracking every Lightning Deal and price drop as it lands, but you don't have to wait — there are already some solid early deals worth shopping right now.\n\nNew and notable early Prime Day deals for the weekend include the AirPods 4 back at $90 (within a buck of their previous all-time low), and the AirPods Pro 2 dropping down to $170, which is almost $80 less than the new AirPods Pro 3. Other new Apple deals include the iPad A16 dropping back down to $299 and the iPad Air dropping to $449, representing a $50 and $150 savings versus buying these tablets at the Apple Store right now.\n\nThe best early Amazon Prime Day deals\n\nAmazon New Apple iPad, 11-Inch $299 $349 Save $50 The newest iPad is an ultra-light, thin tablet that's powerful enough to replace your laptop for most tasks but slips into your bag with room to spare. With a spacious 11-inch Liquid Retina display, you're swiping and scrolling in vibrant color and sharpness that makes any screen that came before it feel like an old tube TV. It's also our pick for the overall best iPad for most users. Why? Well, this iPad is ready to keep up with whatever you throw its way. If you've got a habit of toggling among a dozen apps, streaming videos and replying to messages simultaneously, you're in for a treat. And if you're into gaming, the graphics capabilities mean you can play even demanding games without dropping a frame. $299 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Insignia 40-inch F40 Series LED Full HD Fire TV $99 $150 Save $51 You really can't beat $99 for a 40-inch TV, as long as you are okay with the basics. While it's only a 1080p TV (no 4K, sadly), the discount on this Insignia model makes it the same price as its 32-inch sibling. Not a bad deal for an extra eight inches. You won't get the world's best picture quality here, but that's fine at this price. You do, however, get access to Fire TV apps, which means you can stream content from any service you can think of. With Amazon Alexa built in, you can also control the TV and nearby smart home gadgets using only your voice. $99 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $99 at Best Buy\n\nAmazon Amazon Fire TV 50\" 4-Series 4K UHD smart TV $260 $400 Save $140 Sometimes you just want an affordable TV that does its job and does it well. That's what you get with the Amazon Fire TV line, and this 50-inch model is down to $260. This matches its lowest-ever price that we last saw earlier this year. As its name suggests, this TV runs on Amazon's Fire TV platform, so you have access to all of the smart TV apps you could want. It also features a 4K screen with HDR to keep movies looking crisp. If you have a lot of Amazon devices around your home, it'll also work great with Alexa skills and smart home automations. $260 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple Watch Series 11 $389 $399 Save $10 The Apple Watch Series 11 has barely been on shelves for a week, and it's already seeing a rare $10 discount. That might not sound like much, but Apple gear rarely dips below MSRP this soon after launch. The Series 11 builds on the previous model with a brighter always-on display, a more scratch-resistant screen and improved sleep tracking. And you're still getting all-day (up to 24 hours) battery life, 64GB of storage and the full suite of health and fitness sensors. If you're coming from a Series 9 or earlier, these upgrades — plus the chance to save a little right out of the gate — make it worth a serious look. $389 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Amazon Fire TV Stick HD $18 $35 Save $17 | Lowest price ever Tired of dealing with a menagerie of remotes every time you want to watch TV? Stop the insanity with this easy and intuitive top-seller (which happens to be the newest model) that can replace 'em all. You'll be able to effortlessly switch between the news, sports, live TV and your favorite streaming platforms for easy access to millions of shows and movies. Save $17 | Lowest price ever $18 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Iniu Portable Charger $22 $30 Save $8 The Iniu charger usually goes for $30, making it a juicy 38% off. Compared to similar power banks, this is an absolute steal, especially for something with 10,000 mAh of power. And this is just above the best price ever, so no need to look elsewhere. $22 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple AirTags, 4-Pack $75 $99 Save $24 Thanks to AirTags, I can track my bags from drop-off to the plane to the luggage carousel. And even when the worst happens, and my bags end up in Orlando when I'm in Michigan (true story), I know where they are and how to find them. \"First, we bought one Apple AirTag for my husband's wallet. Then we bought a second one for his car keys,\" said this repeat buyer. \"Now, we have a four-pack, which is cheaper, for our golf bags and checked roller bags.\" $75 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Amazon 40-Inch Fire TV $170 $250 Save $80 This highly rated (and reasonably priced) telly is the one Goldilocks would likely opt for; not too big, not too small, just right. High-def resolution and Dolby Digital Audio help enhance the viewing experience with clear picture and sound, and you'll have easy access to all of your favorite streaming platforms in one place. At just $180, this price matches the TV's lowest of the year. $170 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Apple 2024 MacBook Pro $1,399 $1,599 Save $200 Looking for the best of the best? Speaking as someone who has used one every workday for the past 13 years, a MacBook Pro is likely exactly what you're looking for. This one — also at its best price to date — was released just a few months ago and comes with some of the latest features, like Apple Intelligence and the advanced M4 chip. It also has a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, one of the crispest in the entire MacBook lineup. \"This laptop will last a decade. The battery lasts forever. I do mild development work for my job, and this laptop is capable of handling all the Python code without issue,\" said this snake handler. \"This is perfect for students, professionals and more.\" $1,399 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Beats Studio Buds+ $150 $170 Save $20 Whether you'd like to drown out the sound of your neighbor's bagpipe lessons or the roar of the garbage truck as it comes down your block, these noise-cancelling earbuds have you covered. Boasting up to 36 hours of listening time, they offer a top-tier listening experience, though you can also switch to transparency mode if you need to keep an ear out for the doorbell. They've only been marked down for less once, and that was during Prime Day. $150 at Amazon\n\nApple Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) $179 $249 Save $70 The 2023-released SE has everything you need, from trackers for your heart rate and steps to crash detection, and nothing you don't. So if you've been waiting for an Apple Watch to go on sale, this deal is for you. The price is unlikely to drop any further until holiday sales begin. \"The durability is outstanding. I was a bit careless and forgot the watch in my pants when I was doing laundry,\" said a forgetful fan. \"Luckily, after a 40-minute wash and a 50-minute dry on high heat, the watch worked perfectly fine.\" $179 at Amazon\n\nAmazon Roku Streaming Stick Plus 4K $24 $40 Save $16 Amazon's 4K Fire TV stick may have jumped back up in price, but at under $30 this Roku is a downright steal, including a voice remote that also controls your TV, so you can forget about having to use multiple remotes at once anymore. It comes with all of the top apps you use every day — Netflix, Max, ESPN — as well as thousands more for those more obscure shows, channels and movies you like to watch. $24 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $38 at Macy's\n\nHisense Hisense 55\" E6 Cinema Series QLED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV $260 $430 Save $170 At 35% off, this Hisense TV deal is a great all-around pick if you need a solid living room TV at an all-time low price. Powered by a QLED panel, you'll get colors that pop, making everything from sports to dramas and video games look great. It also includes support for every HDR format, so that means you're prepared whether you need Dolby Vision or HDR 10. If you need smart TV features, this set is powered by Amazon's Fire TV OS, which comes with all of the entertainment apps you might need. Alexa is also just a button press away, allowing you to use voice controls for both the TV and any smart home gadgets you might have connected to Alexa. $260 at Amazon\n\nOctober Prime Day FAQs\n\nYou've got Prime Day questions? We've got Prime Day answers:\n\nWhen is October Prime Day 2025?\n\nAmazon Prime Big Deals Days will only run for two days (as opposed to the four-day event in July). The sale kicks off on Tuesday, October 7th, and continues through Wednesday, October 8th. Make sure you set a reminder so you don't miss out on the biggest deals (and if this summer's sale is any indicator, the best deals will go fast).\n\nWhat will be on sale during October Prime Day?\n\nAmazon is pretty tight-lipped about what markdowns we can expect once the sale kicks off; however, previous Prime Day events have proven to be some of the best times of the year to score all-time low prices on tech. We usually see major price drops on Apple products, as well as Amazon's own in-house gadgets, like Ring doorbells and Fire TV sticks. (Pro tip: Amazon is apparently announcing more new devices on September 30th, so the company may be prepping to clear even more space in its warehouses.) It's also a good idea to get a head start on gift shopping, so you're not scrambling in a couple of months. Why not check some names off your list before you've even opened your first bag of Halloween candy?\n\nDo I need to have an Amazon Prime membership?\n\nIf you're not a Prime member, you won't miss out completely — there will be deals that non-Prime members will be able to take advantage of, too. That said, most of the best Prime Day deals are exclusive to Prime members, so having a subscription will help you make the most of the event. Thankfully, signing up can't possibly be easier, and new members can even opt for a free 30-day trial (after which, you'll be charged $139 each year — don't worry, you can cancel any time).\n\nScore these Prime Day deals well ahead of the big day. (Amazon)\n\nIf you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here. (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $35 or more.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nShop Prime Day deals: Early October Prime Day 2025 deals | Early Prime Day tech deals | Best credit card for Amazon",

      "content": "The Aluminum Association released preliminary estimates as part of its monthly Aluminum Situation statistical report that show a 4.4% year-over-year decline in aluminum demand for North America (U.S. and Canada) through H1 of 2025. While a significant decline in exports was a main contributor to the overall contraction, demand fell in all market segments, with the exception of foil.\n\n“We are carefully monitoring the market as more data becomes available on how the current tariff landscape is impacting the industry,” said Charles Johnson, president & CEO of the Aluminum Association. “As we look ahead, it’s critical to ensure trade policies support — not strain — the U.S. aluminum industry. With 98% of American aluminum jobs in the mid-and downstream sectors, we need a more targeted trade approach that protects against unfair practices while keeping America’s aluminum industry strong and competitive.”\n\nAmong key takeaways from the report:\n\nAluminum demand in the United States and Canada (shipments by domestic producers plus imports) totaled an estimated 13.1 billion pounds through June 2025, declining 4.4% from the like-2024 total of 13.7 billion pounds\n\nThe association's Domestic Producers Shipments & Inventories report indicates that producer shipments from U.S. and Canadian facilities decreased 4.5% year-over-year through June. This number excludes imports to more clearly reflect industry aluminum and aluminum product shipments by North American firms.\n\nThe decline in domestic producer shipments was driven primarily by a decline in aluminum mill products, which contracted 1.6% while shipments of aluminum ingot for castings, exports and destructive uses declined 11% year-over-year.\n\nAluminum scrap inventory increased 14.7% so far in 2025, driven by tariff policy that is incentivizing the use of scrap.\n\nImports of aluminum and aluminum products into North America increased 15.8% year-over-year in the first half, entirely driven by imports of unwrought aluminum.\n\nThe U.S. aluminum industry invested more than $10 billion in U.S. operations over the past 10 years, powered by strong demand, strategic trade enforcement and a stable policy environment. The Trump administration has consistently acknowledged aluminum’s critical role in both economic and national security. However, the administration’s universal 50% aluminum tariff risks undoing hard-earned gains and jeopardizes a decade of progress. The Aluminum Association is calling on policymakers to pursue a more focused, targeted approach to trade—one that strengthens the domestic industry without disrupting the 98% of industry jobs that rely on access to affordable aluminum inputs.\n\nThe Aluminum Situation report is one of more than two-dozen ongoing industry statistical reports developed exclusively by the Aluminum Association through surveys of aluminum producers, fabricators and recyclers.

      "title": "The best makeup removers for mature skin in 2025, tested and reviewed",
      "content": "Waking up with remnants of last night's smoky eye or crusty concealer is among my biggest beauty pet peeves. In my mind, I should be rewarded for washing my face before bed after a long day, not punished with raccoon eyes in the morning. While there remains an array of fantastic face washes on the market, the best makeup removers are specially formulated to gently, effortlessly break down ingredients in cosmetics, including stubborn, waterproof formulas. Using a highly effective makeup remover is particularly important as we age. That's because any rough rubbing (with water or even mild face wash) can damage thinner and more delicate mature skin, causing an influx of fine lines and wrinkles, not to mention irritation.\n\nThe world of makeup removal is surprisingly vast and consists of items that may be unfamiliar to many consumers, including cleansing balms, micellar waters, oil-based face washes, makeup wipes and even cleansing \"milks.\" Of these, certain formulas are generally better for over-40 skin like mine that now suffers from a lack of moisture. Since my skin is much drier than it was five years ago (thanks, perimenopause!), some of my harsher go-to makeup removers are no longer right for me. Instead, I've discovered more emollient formulas — those I once avoided because they caused breakouts — are now much more beneficial to soothing and hydrating my older skin.\n\nIt’s not just the annoyance of mascara-ridden eyelids (or dirty pillowcases!) that a good makeup remover can help prevent. Over my years as a beauty writer, dermatologists have told me time and again that keeping skin clean is imperative to overall skin health. Residual makeup can cause clogged pores, breakouts, dryness, irritation and even premature aging. That’s because makeup can trap dirt, debris, and environmental pollutants in the skin, which stresses it out and, in turn, accelerates aging. (We won’t even get into the terrifying possibility of eye infections.) Read on for the best makeup removers of 2025.\n\nTable of contents\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUpdate, August 15, 2025: We checked all product prices and availability. Our number one pick for the best makeup remover remains unchanged.\n\nThe best makeup removers of 2025\n\nBioderma Best makeup remover overall Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water Key ingredients: Fatty acid ester micelles, pharmaceutical-grade water | Benefits: Cleanses skin of makeup and impurities, and mitigates redness, discomfort and dryness | Size: 16.9 oz | Formula type: Micellar water | Skin type: Sensitive and normal It should come as little surprise that the French invented micellar water, a product I consider to be among the best skin care on the market today. For the uninitiated, micellar water is a cleansing solution composed of micelles, which are tiny cleansing oil molecules that work like magnets, attracting and removing dirt, oil, makeup and any other gunk settling into your pores. Unlike a regular face cleanser, you don’t even need water to use it. You soak a cotton pad with the micellar water, gently wipe it over your face and the micelles activate. It’s almost like magic. There are some pretty good micellar waters out there, but of those I've tested, nothing beats the French original: Bioderma Sensibio H2O. It removes makeup and dirt swiftly and is the only micellar water that doesn’t irritate my eyes or make them burn (which, as a heavy-duty liquid eyeliner aficionado, is an absolute deal breaker). I’ve used this product for almost a decade and nothing comes close. I’m not alone in my Sensibio H2O obsession. Celebrities like Tracee Ellis Ross, Victoria Beckham, Gwyneth Paltrow and Drew Barrymore have all proclaimed their love for the micellar water, with Barrymore once calling it “by far the best makeup remover” she has ever used. Pros Gentle around eyes\n\nFragrance-free and alcohol-free\n\nFormulated for sensitive skin\n\nSwiftly removes makeup with little pressure Cons Need to use cotton pads with product\n\nNot strong enough to remove some liquid lipstick $21 at Amazon\n\nEVE LOM Best makeup remover balm Eve Lom the Original Balm Cleanser Key ingredients: Clove, eucalyptus and Egyptian chamomile oils; cocoa butter | Benefits: Tones and exfoliates skin, removes waterproof makeup, hydrates skin for up to 12 hours after use | Size: 1.6 oz | Formula type: Balm Now that my skin is drier, the harsh foam cleansers I once used to wash my face and remove my makeup are off-limits. These days, I need an oil-based solution, like this rich balm, like this from Eve Lom, which is straight heaven on your skin. It’s made with plant and botanical oils, such as clove, eucalyptus, Egyptian chamomile and cocoa butter. It’s also described as a 5-in-1 product that, aside from cleansing and removing makeup, hydrates, exfoliates and tones the skin. To use, you scoop a small amount (not much is needed, which is great) and rub it into your dry skin. Then, you take the muslin cloth included in the box, soak it with hot water, ring it out, press it onto face and gently wipe away your makeup. It can take a couple of repeat steps of rinsing the cloth, soaking it with warm water and removing the makeup, but it fully cleanses away even my most stubborn mascara and eyeshadows. Another big bonus is that this doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or get into my eyes like other balms. Pros Hydrates skin for up to 12 hours\n\nComes with 100% muslin cloth\n\nNon pore-clogging\n\nFormulated without parabens, phthalates, DEA, MEA, sulphates, synthetic fragrance or colorants\n\nClinically proven to reduce whiteheads and blackheads after 14 days Cons Pricey but a little goes a long way\n\nHas a light, natural fragrance, but is too much for some reviewers $51 at Macy's Explore More Buying Options $60 at Amazon$30 at Nordstrom Rack\n\nMedik8 Best oil-based makeup remover Medik8 Lipid-Balance Cleansing Oil Key ingredients: Safflower oil, moringa extract, linoleic acid and vitamin E | Benefits: Gently dissolves heavy makeup, sunscreen and impurities, nourishes skin barrier and is alcohol and paraben-free | Size: 4.7 oz | Formula type: Oil cleanser As I mentioned with the balm, I really appreciate oil cleansers. However, it’s not just the hydrating aspect; they work hard (yet gentle) at removing heavy makeup. This oil cleanser has become a mainstay in my makeup-removal routine. I’m able to cleanse off both heavy eyeliner and waterproof liquid lipstick with it, no problem. The formula is has a ton going for it — it’s made with antioxidant ingredients like moringa extract and vitamin E, as well as fatty acids like safflower oil and omega-6. Which means: All that makeup is coming off my skin, but it’s not stripping it of moisture. Like cleansing balms, oils like this one are applied right onto dry skin. Once you add a drop or two of warm water, the formula emulsifies into a smooth, milky texture. I always feel like I’m “treating” my skin when I’m using this makeup remover. Also, it lasts forever! Yes, it’s a bit pricey at almost $40, but you'll be using it for literal months. Pros Removes waterproof makeup and sunscreen\n\nNo artificial fragrance or synthetic colors\n\nCertified vegan\n\nLuxurious texture Cons A little pricey (but lasts a long time)\n\nMade with essential oils which some people are sensitive to $38 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $38 at Dermstore\n\n(back to top)\n\nA glimpse at my makeup remover testing, including products from Naturium, Eve Lom, Caudalie, Garnier, Medik8, Eadem, Bioderma and Renée Rouleau (Marie Lodi)\n\nHow we tested makeup removers\n\nTo find the best makeup removers, I used my over-decade-long expertise as a beauty editor and my 30-something years of experience wearing makeup (I, ahem, technically wore lipstick in the first grade). After applying a full face of makeup — foundation, concealer, eye makeup, a highly pigmented lip tint) — I tested at least a dozen different makeup removers over three weeks, from micellar waters to cleansing balms and everything in between. I rated each based on efficacy (did it remove even my heaviest eye makeup with ease?), ingredients (is it clean?), formula quality, texture and feel (was it gentle on my eyes?). I also noted the value and whether it was worth a higher price or it was a quality budget buy.\n\n(back to top)\n\nOther makeup removers we tested that didn't make the cut\n\nGarnier Micellar Cleansing Water: Now, I’m sure people (other beauty editors) might argue with me for not putting Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water on this list — it’s extremely popular and has almost 40,000 five-star Amazon reviews! However, while it is effective at removing makeup, it burns my eyes (even the sensitive version), which is why Bioderma Sensibio is my No. 1 pick.\n\nNeutrogena Make-Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes: These makeup wipes like are classic (and good to have with you for emergencies), but I don’t find them as effective at removing an entire face of makeup as the other types of products listed here, not to mention the incredible amount of waste they create.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n(back to top)\n\nMakeup remover FAQs\n\nWhat is the best way to remove waterproof mascara?\n\nWaterproof mascara and lipsticks are formulated to last hours (sometimes even more than 24 hours!). It’s impressive, especially if you’ve ever tried to remove these products with a regular face wash without success. Oil-based makeup removers or cleansing balms are the most effective for breaking down waterproof formulas. This is because they can draw out other oil-based debris, like makeup. Depending on the oil cleanser, you may have to follow up with a second cleanser, which you’ll learn about below.\n\nDo I need to double-cleanse when removing makeup?\n\nIf I haven’t stressed this enough: It’s absolutely important to remove all your makeup before bed. If you’re still seeing remnants of makeup or find that your makeup remover feels too oily, a double-cleansing routine can be beneficial. First, use your makeup remover, then follow up with a mild face cleanser to dissolve any leftover residue and ensure your skin is completely clean.\n\nWhat type of makeup remover is best for my skin type?\n\nNot all makeup removers are the same. For dry skin, look for hydrating options like oil-based cleansers, balms or a cream cleanser with moisturizing ingredients. If your skin is oily, a gel-based makeup remover might be best. You can also search for labels that contain “non-comedogenic.” Sensitive skin types should look for formulas that are fragrance-free, alcohol-free and free of harsh ingredients.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe received complimentary samples of some products and purchased others ourselves, but we reviewed all products using the same objective criteria.\n\n(back to top)",

      "content": "Chinese consumers propelled gold demand in the past few years, but they are now piling into stocks.\n\nHave an account? Log in .\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nGold has been on a record-setting blitz this year. But Chinese investors are increasingly turning their backs on the precious metal in favor of a surging domestic stock market.\n\nIn August, China's wholesale gold demand fell to just 85 metric tons — nine tons lower than in July. It was also the weakest August since 2010, according to the World Gold Council in a Tuesday report.\n\n\"The August wholesale gold demand weakness mainly came from subdued bar and coin sales, as investors directed their attention to rallying equities,\" wrote Ray Jia, the research head for China at World Gold Council.\n\nThe retreat came as gold prices on the London Bullion Market Association rose nearly 4% while China's onshore benchmark gained 2%.\n\nPrices of gold — a traditional inflation hedge and haven asset — hit a record high above $3,700 per troy ounce on Tuesday. Prices have been on the up this year thanks to Fed rate cut bets, geopolitical tensions, and President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nWary, price-weary Chinese investors\n\nIn China, consumers have been reliable buyers of gold over the past two years, particularly after an ongoing property crisis and a stock market slump left few attractive investment alternatives.\n\nJewelry purchases rebounded in 2023 and 2024, and retail investors piled into gold ETFs as a hedge against economic uncertainty and a weakening yuan.\n\nBut 2025 has been different. Despite the People's Bank of China adding to its gold reserves for 10 straight months, private demand has stumbled.\n\nETF investors pulled 6 billion Chinese yuan, or $834 million, in August, cutting holdings by 7.7 tons, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nGold futures trading activity on the Shanghai Futures Exchange also fell 26% from July to August.\n\nPart of the problem is price fatigue: Gold's relentless climb has deterred new buying.\n\nThe tonnage of gold withdrawn from the Shanghai Gold Exchange — the best proxy for wholesale demand — has remained muted throughout 2025 compared with historical averages.\n\nChinese equities catch fire\n\nWhile gold demand has faltered, equities have surged.\n\nThe CSI300 Index, which tracks China's largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, jumped 10% in August and is about 16% higher year to date.\n\nThat surge came on the back of aggressive policy support, including liquidity injections and pledges to bolster consumer spending and technology investment.\n\nRetail traders, often described as the lifeblood of China's stock market, have poured back in. Daily equity trading volumes have swelled, coinciding with declines in gold futures activity.\n\nThe contrast underscores how investors are rotating out of traditional safe-haven assets and into riskier plays as confidence returns.\n\nHowever, gold investment demand in China could rebound later this year, supported by seasonal buying around the National Day holiday in October and various jewelry fairs in September, according to the World Gold Council.",

      "content": "Viaim RecDot earbuds ZDNET's key takeaways The Viaim RecDot earbuds are avilable now on Amazon for $199\n\nThese earbuds make real-time translation far easier than you can imagine\n\nThe Viaim RecDot earbuds also happen to sound fantastic. $199.2 at Amazon $229 at Walmart more buying choices\n\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nAn earbud is an earbud… right?\n\nUntil it offers a feature that's seriously impressive.\n\nOne such pair is the Viaim RecDot, which can serve as an AI voice recorder, earbuds, AI meeting assistant with transcription, translate to and from 78 Languages, flash record, make to-do lists & summaries with Viaim AI, and offers up to 48dB ANC for Meetings, Interviews & Lectures.\n\nAlso: Best early Amazon Prime Day headphones deals 2025: My favorites deals ahead of the sale\n\nI had my doubts until I gave these earbuds a go. Let's discover, shall we?\n\nMy experience\n\nBefore I tested the Viaim Recdots as standard earbuds, I decided to first give the special features a try. Before I could get to that stage, I had to install the Viaim app on my Android 9 Pro, sign up for an account (it's free), pair the earbuds with the phone and the app, update the firmware, and then reconnect them.\n\nWhew.\n\nThe Viaim RecDot earbuds are ready to rock or translate. jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nWith that taken care of, I opened the app, tapped record, selected \"Live Recording\" from the types of transcription available. I then recorded a simple voice message, tapped the three-dot menu button at the top of the display and hit Translate.\n\nIt then gives you a list of languages to translate into, and the AI does its thing. The translation happened far faster than I would have assumed, and once it was finished, it displayed the translated lines below the originals.\n\nColor me impressed.\n\nIt gets better.\n\nAlso: How you're cleaning your earbuds and headphones isn't ideal - here's the right way to do it\n\nThe next test was to use the live translation feature. Essentially, what this does is listen to someone speaking in one language and automatically translates it into another in real time. This would be outstanding for those who travel a lot and don't have time to actually learn the language.\n\nI've used tools like this before, and none have really impressed me. However, the Viaim RedDot certainly did. The one thing you have to do is make sure to select the right languages. For example, if I want to translate English to French, I would select French for the earbuds and English for the phone.\n\nOnce I hit the mic button, the phone translates what was said in English into French in real time.\n\nThe real time translation is very impressive. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nBasically, it all works very well, and I could imagine this feature alone making these earbuds worth the cost ($199 on Amazon), especially for the right person.\n\nBut what about the sound? Can you use the RecDot earbuds as traditional earbuds? You certainly can, and they impress in that area, as well.\n\nThe Viaim RecDot earbuds offer plenty of EQ presets, and there is also a custom option that gives you an 8-band equalizer. It took me all of 30 seconds to make the adjustments to the EQ curve to better match my hearing.\n\nOnce that was dialed in, the RecDot earbuds came to life. That's not to say the Balanced EQ (the default) is bad -- it's not. In fact, the RecDot Balanced EQ sounds better than a lot of custom curves I've added for other earbuds apps. But when I adjusted the custom option, I found the lows to be more present, the highs more crisp, and the mids just perfect.\n\nAlso: Why I no longer travel without these Sony headphones - even after testing competing models\n\nThe presets work well with the genres they are assigned to. For example, the Pop EQ option brings out the mids, which is where the voice lives (and pop is all about the voice). This is one of the first pairs of earbuds that I could see myself switching EQs based on the genre I'm listening to. Most often, I create a custom EQ and leave it at that.\n\nThe Viaim RecDot earbuds specialize in transcribing and translating, something they do very well. But the added bonus is that they sound fantastic.\n\nZDNET buying advice\n\nThese earbuds are a bit tricky. Because of their $199 price point, it's certainly possible to find earbuds that sound as good or better. The thing is, you don't buy a pair of earbuds like the Viaim RecDot earbuds unless you need the translate/transcribe features. If you do need those options, they should be your first consideration.\n\nAlso: These wireless headphones transported me to audio nirvana - and are my new all-time favorite\n\nIf you think you might someday need the translate/transcribe features, and you also want a pair of earbuds that sound great, the Viaim RecDots are a great option. I you're certain that you'll never use the translate/transcribe features, move on to another pair of earbuds.\n\nThe Viaim RecDot earbuds seriously impressed me on all fronts. The transcribe/translate feature works brilliantly, and the sound is quite good.\n\nViaim RecDot earbuds tech specs\n\n11mm titanium-coated dynamic drivers.\n\nUp to 9 hours of battery life (36 hours with the case).\n\n48dB depth active noise cancellation.\n\nBluetooth 5.2, supports dual-device connections.\n\nLHDC audio codec.\n\nAI-powered real-time transcription and translation\n\nA triple microphone array with a bone conduction microphone.",

      "content": "The world’s biggest independent oil trader, Vitol, has appointed Douglas Booth as head of copper concentrates . He is the third trader to join the company’s revived metals team so far this year. The move continues the build-out of Vitol’s metals team. It follows the recruitment of Bruno Porto as head of copper in March and the addition of Adrien de Sousa as trader in the refined copper team in June.\n\nNew appointments strengthen team\n\nBooth announced his move on LinkedIn on October 1. He joins from IXM in Geneva where he had worked as a senior copper trader since early 2023.\n\nPrior to IXM, Booth spent more than 12 years at Glencore as a senior copper trader at the company’s Baar headquarters in Switzerland.\n\nDe Sousa joined from SEFE Marketing & Trading. He had been senior vice president of energy transition metals and minerals in Singapore since October 2024.\n\n\n\nPrior to SEFE, de Sousa spent almost 10 years at Mitsubishi Corporation RtM International in Singapore. There, he served as general manager of the refined metal division and carbon from April 2020 to October 2024. He also served as lead aluminium trader from March 2015 to March 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before Mitsubishi, de Sousa was a senior aluminium trader at Norway’s Norsk Hydro.\n\nPorto joined Vitol after 18 years at Glencore.\n\nHow Vitol copper business is evolving beyond energy markets\n\nVitol’s expansion into copper comes as energy traders increasingly move into the metals markets. They are capitalizing on profits earned during the volatility in energy markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to media reports.\n\nAt a conference in April 2024, Vitol chief executive officer Russell Hardy confirmed that the oil giant was starting to rebuild a metals trading book after a long absence from the market. He described it as “a relatively small addition to our business” with an “exciting decade” ahead.\n\nThe company previously traded metals through Euromin in the 1990s but exited the business after struggling with risk management. Hardy said that Vitol was now starting from scratch again.\n\nBeyond copper, Vitol has also expanded into iron ore and aluminium trading in recent years. They hired traders from Glencore and other competitors.\n\nVitol copper trading strategy shows cautious long-term outlook\n\nMarket participants told Fastmarkets that Vitol’s approach in building a copper trading book was more cautious but also more progressive than other new entrants.\n\nThe company is leveraging its extensive balance sheet and market relationships built over the decades in energy trading. Vitol is gradually expanding into copper concentrates, Fastmarkets understands. Sources have characterized Vitol’s strategy as a “three-to-five year project,” reflecting its more long-term view than competitors such as Mercuria which moved aggressively into the metals space earlier this year.\n\nFastmarkets assessed the copper concentrates TC index, cif Asia Pacific – the mid-point between smelter and trader buying levels – at $(63.40) per tonne on Friday September 26. This was down by $0.10 per tonne from $(63.30) per tonne on September 19.",
